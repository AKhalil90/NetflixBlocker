# NetflixBlocker
This is a ***JavaScript*** code that I wrote is inspired from the community demand, on different social media platforms, against Netflix due to the massive inappropate content (e.g. homosexuality, etc.) posted on their network.

I've developed this simple code as a proof-of-concept that blocking movies from client-side is something possible.
 
# Demo Video
This is a demo video so you can see the code in action:

# Further Enhancements
This code can be forked by any developer and developed further. Ideas of further development could be:
- Develop it as a browser-extention, so it can be easily available for non-tech users to download and use it.
- Integrate the code with a central service provider that can control the list of movies to be blocked. You can give the user the ability to subscribe to any service provider to get the list of the blocked movies from.
- You can enhance the functionality and let the user block movies for a certain actor that he don't like!
- ***Go far away with you imagination!***
