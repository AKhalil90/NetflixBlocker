# NetflixBlocker
This is a ***JavaScript*** code that I wrote is inspired from the community demand, on different social media platforms, against Netflix due to the massive inappropate content (e.g. homosexuality, etc.) posted on their network.

I've developed this simple code as a proof-of-concept that blocking movies from client-side is something possible.


 develop it as proper browser-extension, integrate it with a centalized services that control the list of movies to be blocked (e.g. you can even let the user decides with which central service he wants to subscribe to get movies blocked for him). You guys for sure have better ideas than mine, so go ahead with the thing you find more interesting to you.

# Further Enhancements
This code can be forked by any developer and developed further. Ideas of further development could be:
- Develop a proper browser-extention (e.g. Google Chrome extension) and make it available for non-tech users to download and benfit from it.
- Integrate the code with a central service provider that can control the list of movies to be blocked. You can give the user the ability to subscribe to any service provider to get the list of the blocked movies from.
- Go far away with you imagination! You can let the user block movies for a certain actor that he don't like!

I'll leave it to you to do whatever you feel interests you more with this simple code!
